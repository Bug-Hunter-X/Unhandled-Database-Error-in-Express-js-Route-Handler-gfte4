# Unhandled Database Error in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: neglecting error handling within route handlers that interact with databases or external services.

## The Problem

The `bug.js` file shows a route handler that fetches user data from a database.  If the database query fails (e.g., due to network issues, incorrect data, etc.), the error is not handled properly, leading to a server error. This results in an unhelpful error message for the client and potentially crashes the server.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the correct way to handle errors.  The code includes comprehensive error handling with clear error messages for both the client and server. The solution provides proper status codes and robust handling of unexpected behavior.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory in your terminal.
3. Run `node bug.js` (or similar based on your setup).
4. Attempt to access a route that causes a database error (simulate this if you don't have a real database). Note the error message.
5. Repeat with `node bugSolution.js` to see how to fix the issue.

## Key Improvements

* **Explicit Error Handling:**  Catches errors and responds gracefully with appropriate HTTP status codes.
* **Informative Error Messages:** Provides descriptive messages to help debug issues.
* **Improved Server Stability:** Prevents crashes and ensures a more robust application.
* **Client-Side Awareness:**  Returns meaningful error responses to the client, allowing for better user experience.
